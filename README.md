A barebones react/express app built from the ground up to help with webpack/express/react scaffolding. This is a great way to learn, and hopefully a great way to scaffold future projects

1. To start `cd` into project directory
2. Install node modules with `npm i`
3. Run the project with `npm run start`, this will webpack the directories and run the server
4. Browser your server at `http://localhost:3000`
